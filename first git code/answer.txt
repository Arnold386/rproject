Since the answers are yes or no;
we would have to  put into consideration that people are likely to make mistakes
such as ye,y,ys,n,non.
therefore these would be considered as noise but we hv to develop
our system to be able to take up all the possibilities as answers.
these would be
yes-yes
no-no
n-no
y-yes
non-no
ye-yes
ys-yses
